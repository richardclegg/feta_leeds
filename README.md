## Making the plots

I've included plot files for the Enron mixtures over time, the degree power experiments and the Rank Preference/BA ones, with instructions in the `enron_plot_files` and `artificial_data_plotfiles/degreepower` and `artificial_data_plotfiles/BArankpref` folders respectively. They're all made using python3 - I think the only packages you'll need are numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn?
